# Music-Player
I'm excited to share my latest project with you all. I've built a fully functional music player from scratch, and it's a great showcase of my web development skills. With a sleek and user-friendly interface, my music player lets you listen to your favorite tunes, control playback, and even see song details and cover art.
Here's what I've accomplished:
✅ HTML/CSS: Designed an elegant and responsive user interface to make the music player visually appealing and easy to use.
✅ JavaScript: Implemented the core functionality, allowing for play, pause, seeking, and song information display.
✅ Music Library: Integrated a collection of songs and album covers to enhance the user experience.
✅ UX/UI: Focused on creating a seamless and enjoyable listening experience.

Check out my music player in action and let me know what you think. Feel free to try it out and provide your feedback. I'm always looking to improve and expand my skills, and this project was a great learning experience.
